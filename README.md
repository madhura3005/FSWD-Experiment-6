#Aim:
Building a RESTful API with Express
Create routes for CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on a mock dataset. Use Express middleware for request handling and validation.

#Conclusion:
In this experiment, we successfully built a RESTful API using Node.js and Express, implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a mock dataset. By setting up different HTTP routes, we learned how to handle requests and responses efficiently. Additionally, we explored Express middleware for request processing and validation.
For testing, we used Postman to send POST, PUT, and DELETE requests and validated responses. Alternatively, we demonstrated how to use the browser console with the fetch API to interact with the API without requiring additional tools.
This experiment provided a strong foundation in backend development, equipping us with the skills to build, test, and manage API endpoints effectively. It also highlighted the importance of middleware, request validation, and structured API responses, which are essential for developing scalable and maintainable web applications.
